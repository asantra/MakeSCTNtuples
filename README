This is the repository to make ntuples for SCT histogram. 

1. First, one has to run usual SCTLorentzMonTool.cxx with cout statements (one such file is kept in this repository).
2. Download the log files from the grid. 
3. In the same directory where the unzipped log files are kept, run OpenLog.py:

python OpenLog.py <name of the output root file name without .root extension>

4. The above code should produce one root file from each log file, and after all the log files, this code will produce a combined root file using hadd. 

5. Details:
 a. MakeTree.C is the actual code which produces root ntuple from the log file.
 b. MakeLib.sh just compiles MakeTree.C and prepare the library.
 c. RunRootMASTER.sh runs the previously made library. 
 d. Steps a to c are wrapped into OpenLog.py.
